                <font size="5">
                    The pythagorean theorem was invented by a man named pythagoras
                    back in 500 bce. it is used to tell the length of a right
                    triangles hypothenuse by squaring side a (The triangles shortest side)
                    and adding it to side b squared (side b is the triangles middle length side).
                </font>
                <br>
                <font size="5">
                    the first step to doing the pythagorean theorem is to add a squared to b squared, 
                    the sum of these two numbers is equal to c squared, finally you want to find the 
                    square root of c squared. The square root of c squared is equal to c which is the 
                    length of your right triangles hypothenuse. Congratulations! 
                    You have sucessfully done the pythagorean theorem.

            then you multiply that number by itself once such as 9*9 13*13
            or 17*17

            <font size="3">Square Root : A numbers square root is a number that can be 
                multiplied by itself to equal that number
                such as the square root of 49 is 7 because 7 * 7 = 49 
                or the square root of 36 is 6 because 6 * 6 = 36.
